    "\n",
    "Home Sweet is about finding your perfect person, family, and life and settling down. I think the difference we see here is the sentiment of the words themselves and the feelings that they provoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Holy Smokes the more I think about it may be pretty spot on considering some of the language and verbage used. There are a lot of things with negative connotations I'd say in the song that could keep it closer to neutral. For instance the first verse starts with \"Well, I was only scared of the devil and her dad.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Eyes on You is a song that reminisces about a couple's travels throughout America and how all he can look at is her. I thought this song would've been closer to 1 than a negative connotation, and I'm not totally sure what is making it negative. The only thing that I can think of is the use of the word 'no' a lot making it negative.\n",

    "Lies Lies Lies is a song about a heartbreak that hasn't healed and is seemingly getting worse. This was pretty much the polarity score I expected, if not a little more negative. It is a rather short song, so that could be why it's not more negative."
